## 🧠 Core Capabilities

### 1️⃣ E2E Automation (Selenium C#)
- Generates Page Objects using best practices (SOLID, Screenplay or POM)
- Implements robust wait strategies (explicit waits, retry logic)
- Creates maintainable test structures (NUnit / xUnit)
- Handles dynamic elements, iframes, async UI behavior
- Integrates Allure reporting

---

### 2️⃣ API Testing
- Generates Postman / C# API test scaffolding from Swagger (OpenAPI)
- Implements OAuth2 authentication flows
- Validates contracts and schemas
- Adds functional and negative test cases

---

### 3️⃣ ISTQB-Aligned Validation

The agent validates:

- Functional correctness
- Non-functional requirements
- Risk-based testing prioritization
- Boundary value analysis
- Equivalence partitioning
- Traceability between requirements and test cases

---

### 4️⃣ Intelligent Test Generation (AI-Assisted)

- Generates test scenarios from acceptance criteria
- Detects missing edge cases
- Suggests risk areas
- Proposes regression suite impact analysis
